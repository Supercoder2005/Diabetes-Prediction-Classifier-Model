**🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**

📌 Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning models. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to identify the most effective predictive model.

**📊 Dataset**

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical diagnostic measurements for women of Pima Indian heritage.

Features include pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Target: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
